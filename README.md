# ‚òï Filtering the Grind: Machine Learning on Noisy Sales Data from a Caf√©

This repository contains a machine learning project that transforms noisy, real-world caf√© sales data into actionable business insights. The project tackles challenges like missing values, outliers, and categorical inconsistencies using advanced preprocessing and regression models like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Gradient Boosting**.

## üìå Project Goals

- üìä Predict customer **Total Spent** using transactional data  
- üïê Identify **peak business hours** and **popular products**  
- üìà Use ML models to uncover patterns in customer behavior  
- üßπ Clean and process messy real-world data for accurate predictions

## üß† Models Used

| Model              | MAE  | RMSE | R¬≤ Score |
|-------------------|------|------|----------|
| Random Forest      | 3.61 | 5.04 | 0.91     |
| XGBoost            | 3.58 | 4.95 | 0.91     |
| Gradient Boosting  | 3.72 | 5.11 | 0.91     |

üìå **XGBoost** had the best performance with the lowest RMSE. All models showed excellent predictive power (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.91).
